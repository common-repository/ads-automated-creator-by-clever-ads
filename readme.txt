== Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
= Do I need a Google Ads account? =
 
You need a Google Ads account so that we can properly upload your Adwords campaigns. But don't worry, we can have it created for you if you don't have one.

= What languages are compatible with campaigns? =

We are currently able to create Google Ads campaigns in English, French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. 

= How much time do you need to create my Google Ads campaigns? =

It will take our team less than 2 business days to have your Google Ads campaigns reviewed by a Google Ads expert. Clever Ads will contact you via email once we have them ready.

= Does Clever Ads really create my Google Ads campaigns 100% for free? =

Yes! We create your Search and Display Google Ads campaigns for free. The daily budget you select will be fully spent on advertising your business on Google. 

We also activate a Google Ads promo code of up to $150 to all new accounts.

= How much should I spend on Google Ads? =

We normally recommend a minimum budget of $15 per day. We have detected that Google Ads accounts investing more than $15 have a remarkably better performance than the ones with a lower budget. 

Accounts with a lower amount have a poor reach and don't have their ads displayed to enough potential customers in order to maximize performance.

= I have more than one website I want to advertise on Google, should I create one Google Ads account per website? =

Definitely. This way you can have separate metrics for each shop and it will be much easier for you to gather performance information about each one.

= How do I know when my Google Ads campaigns are ready? =

Clever Ads will contact you via email once we have your Google Ads campaigns ready and uploaded to your account.
